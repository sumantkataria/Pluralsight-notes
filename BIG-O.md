1. Asymptotic analysis of Algorithms
2. BIG-O is worst case scenario &  BIG-Omega is best case.
3. Simplified notation of an algorithm efficiency
4. Complexity in terms of input size, N
5. Machine independent
6. Time & Space
- O(1) < O(logn) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)
7. O(1) = Constant time - function whose cost of the algo is unchanged by the iput size
8. O(n) = Linear time - function whose cost scales linearly with the size of the input
9. O(n^2) = Quadratic time - function that exibits quadratic growth relative to the input size
10. O(logn) = Logarithmic time - function whose cost scales logarithmically with the input size
11. O(2^n) = Exponential time
12. O(n!) = Factorial time
