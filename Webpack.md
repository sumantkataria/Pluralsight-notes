1. Why do we need a build -
    - combining files
    - minifying files
    - maintaining file order
    - transpilation
    - linting
2. Task runners(gulp & grunt) -> transpilation + concatenation + minification
3. Webpack is a specialized task runner that has been optimized to do 1 specific task very well.
4. Webpack gives 1 more feature than task runners i.e. ability to combine css into JS.
